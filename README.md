# Origami Studio Demos
Origami Studio Experiments

These experimental code samples have been created using Origami Studio by Sajid Saiyed (sajid.saiyed@gmail.com)#
Unless specified, these code samples are open source and free to use as long as you retain the credits in the code.

# Slinkin Demo:
This is a recreation of the default sample demo "Slinkin Park".
I have re-created this using Origami Studio and you can see that now you need to use only a few connections to create this.
