## Google Inbox Animation
This is a re-creation of Google Inbox app animation.
There is a lot going on in this:
- The list splits up into two parts, one goes up and one goes down.
- The additional information panel maskes in.
- The header image has a parallax effect when dragged up but no parallax while coming down.
- The additional information page closes if you drag it down to a certain distance and release the touch.

## Instagram Editor (Re-Design)
After experiencing the instagram photo editor for a while, I found that there were a lot of back and forth interactions for very simple controls. I wanted to re-design it so that it is more user friendly and easy to use.

This design is one such attempt to simplify the photo-editor.
